<h2>How they detect phishing?</h2>
<p>Different websites use different algorithms + user-agents + IPs to detect phishing. If they found similarities to original login pages then they simply block the phishing URL and also report it to host provider. And thus your account suspended.</p>

For example, if a person has this type of user-gent (Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.3; en-us; SM-N900T Build/JSS15J) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/534.30) then phishing page will load, Else it will be directed to <b>phishing_info</b> folder. It helps prevent detected by facebook & other crawlers.</p>
